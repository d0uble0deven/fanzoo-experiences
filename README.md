## API Endpoints

### `POST /bookings`

Creates a new booking.

```
{
"experienceId": "exp_105",
"userId": "test-user-id",
"athlete": "Patrick Mahomes",
"timestamp": "2025-01-30T19:24:59.634Z"
}
```

### `GET /bookings`

Retrieves all bookings.

## **If I Had More Time**

### **ðŸ“± Responsiveness**

- Improve left spacing on mobile views.
- iPad Pro has spacing issues. I wanted to use [react-glider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-glider) so each row would be a **glider**, but I did not have time to implement it.

### **ðŸ’³ Stripe API**

- Currently, Stripe validation is turned off.
- I would refine the integration to allow demo cards for testing.
- I would remove the **"Link"** payment option or integrate it better into the flow.

### **ðŸŽ´ Card Designs**

- Introduce **retro sports card** and **PokÃ©mon-style cards**.
- Add **holographic effects**, **stats**, and **animations**.
- Found inspiration from:
  - [CSS Only: Baseball Cards](https://codepen.io/kitjenson/pen/YoLWqX?css-preprocessor=scss)
  - [Digital baseball cards for fictional players](https://codepen.io/kaisle/pen/pqxNPz)
  - [Pokemon Cards V2](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/yeswesurf/3d-css-baseball-cards/main?file=%2Fsrc%2Flib%2Fcomponents%2Fcard-shine.svelte)
